Project Description:
For the something cool, we decided to do the etch a sketch. By moving the joystick, the LEDs will light up and you will be able to draw something on the pi. By pressing in on the joystick,
the user will be able to change the color of the LEDs. The colors are white, red, green and blue.

Usage Instructions:
Push the joystick in to change the color of the LEDs. Then move thr joystick in any direction to draw a picture. To clear the dislay, bump the pi with your hand and the screen will go dark.
Now you can draw on a clean screen.
